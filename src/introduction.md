# Introduction

The job market for software engineers in the United States is extremely challenging. A few market dynamics contribute to this:

- Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) reduce resume's visibility to human eyes and can filter out particular candidates for a variety of reasons that aren't always obvious.
- The ease of applying for jobs online has led to a large number of candidates applying for the same position, which has increased competition.
- Interviewing focuses on testing candidates' knowledge of specific technologies, which doesn't always align with the skills needed for the job.
- Interviewers sometimes don't evaluate underlying skills and capabilities, such as emotional maturity, cognitive development, etc.

The current situation produces work environments that are:

- less diverse, as teams hiring more candidates that are similar in skill- and mindset
- favoring technical skills over cognitive, adaptive skills
- lack cognitive, adaptive skills AND this lack is invisible to the teams themselves

At the core of this problem lies a cognitive pattern: most of what we know, we have learned through experience. Even if we read a piece of information, we don't truly internalize it until we have experienced it ourselves. If a team wants to hire a diverse team, they need to stop relying solely on their own experience to cast a judgement on candidates. Releasing some control over a hiring decision to a wider set of perspectives can help. 

On the other hand, if a candidate wants to get hired into a job, it saves time to know:

- what unspoken preferences or biases interviewers hold
- what challenges the candidate needs to overcome to get hired
- whether a set of skills can be adequately demonstrated in the interviews

To get hired, it is insufficient to be a good engineer. Your perspective of 'good' needs to match the interviewers' perspective as well.

## Proposal

`The Hiring Community` proposes a community-driven platform for coaching and matching candidates to jobs. ATS systems focus on providing value to the hiring team, while ignoring the candidate's needs. `The Hiring Community` aims to first identify the various stakeholders and provide value for all equally.
